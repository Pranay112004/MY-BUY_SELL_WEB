   Build Command: npm run render-postbuild
   Start Command: npm start
   ```

4. **Add Environment Variables:**
   Click "Advanced" → "Add Environment Variable"
   
   ```

## 🔧 **Step 3: Get Your MongoDB Connection String**

If you don't have MongoDB Atlas set up:

1. Go to [MongoDB Atlas](https://cloud.mongodb.com/)
2. Create a free account
3. Create a new cluster
4. Go to "Database Access" → Create a database user
5. Go to "Network Access" → Add IP Address → Allow access from anywhere (`0.0.0.0/0`)
6. Go to "Clusters" → Click "Connect" → "Connect your application"
7. Copy the connection string
8. Replace `<password>` with your database user password

Example connection string:
```
mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster0.xxxxx.mongodb.net/productstore?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

## 🎯 **Step 4: Monitor Deployment**

1. **Watch the Build Logs:**
   - Render will show real-time logs
   - The build process takes 2-5 minutes
   - Look for "Build successful" message

2. **Check for Errors:**
   - If build fails, check the logs
   - Common issues: missing environment variables, dependency errors

3. **Test Your App:**
   - Once deployed, you'll get a URL like: `https://mern-product-store-xxx.onrender.com`
   - Test all features: Create, Read, Update, Delete products

---

## ✨ **Step 5: Your App is Live!**

Once deployment is successful:

🎉 **Your MERN Product Store is now live on the internet!**

**Features that work:**
- ✅ Beautiful responsive UI
- ✅ Product management (CRUD operations)
- ✅ MongoDB database integration
- ✅ Toast notifications
- ✅ Mobile-friendly design

## 🔄 **Step 6: Automatic Deployments**

Render automatically redeploys when you push to your main branch:

1. Make changes to your code
2. Commit and push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your update message"
   git push origin main
   ```
3. Render will automatically rebuild and deploy

---

## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues:**

1. **Build Failed - Missing Dependencies:**
   - Make sure all packages are in `package.json`
   - Check that frontend dependencies are included

2. **Database Connection Error:**
   - Verify MongoDB Atlas connection string
   - Check if IP whitelist includes `0.0.0.0/0`
   - Ensure database user has correct permissions

3. **Environment Variables:**
   - Double-check `MONGO_URI` is correct
   - Ensure `NODE_ENV=production` is set

4. **API Calls Not Working:**
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify API endpoints are accessible

### **Useful Commands:**

- **View Logs:** Go to your service dashboard → "Logs" tab
- **Rebuild:** Dashboard → "Manual Deploy" → "Deploy latest commit"
- **Environment Variables:** Dashboard → "Environment" tab
